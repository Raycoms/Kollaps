# Kollaps examples

This folder contains several example images to illustrate the usage of Kollaps.

- iPerf3: experiment with three iPerf3 clients which will connect to three different iPerf3 servers. Each client will try to saturate the bandwidth for 100 seconds and stop.
Check the shell scripts under the *iperf3-client* and *iperf3-server* directory for further details.

- redis: experiment that uses the Redis database
